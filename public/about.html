<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Ramachandran.I completed my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2016. I have seven years of experience
  in construction
  design industry. Now I’m looking for a career transition from mechanical side to tech side.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons I want to switch to IT is because I believe it offers an exciting blend of problem-solving
  and
  creativity. In my view, the IT sector is driving the digital age we live in, and I want to be part of this dynamic
  industry where I can make a real impact. This industry is advancing at an incredible pace, and I am drawn to the
  constant learning and adaptability it necessitates.</p>
<p>Another reason is that I see a clear overlap between Mechanical Engineering and Software Development. Both require a
  strong analytical mindset and problem-solving ability. During my degree, I have cultivated these skills and I believe
  they can be well applied to the IT industry.</p>
<p>Lastly, the mechanical engineering principles of design, test, and optimization are very similar to the software
  development life cycle. Thus, the skills and the mindset I developed while studying mechanical engineering can
  directly
  translate into a software development.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the shift from Mechanical to IT is not a complete divergence, but rather a fusion of my analytical
  skills
  and creative interests. I’m confident that my strong engineering background, coupled with my passion for coding, makes
  me a unique candidate for this full stack web development role.</p>
